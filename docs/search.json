    "text": "We are interested in how former president Obama and Trump tweet on their personal account. Along with their access to the @POTUS account on Twitter, they also had access to their own personal account. Since @POTUS is the official account for the President of the United States, I was less curious in exploring what they tweeted on this particular account during their presidency; instead, I was interested in what both Obama and Trump would tweet on their personal Twitter accounts. Although both Obama’s and Trump’s Twitter accounts were monitored, they had more freedom on what they posted on their personal accounts rather than the @POTUS account. In this project, I will explore the differences in how Obama and Trump would tweet during their presidency. We begin by data wrangling both Obama’s and Trump’s tweets in order to make meaningful analyses. During this process, I have decided to only include the years of their respective presidency terms. I felt it was more important to analyse how they interacted with the media when they were representing our country.\n\n#wrangling Trump's tweets\ntrump_tweets_ym &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/SDSProjects/maryw-1.github.io/Trumps_Legcy.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(timestamp = mdy_hm(date),\n         year = str_extract(timestamp, \"(\\\\d{4})\")) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 2016) |&gt;\n  mutate(timestamp = as.Date(mdy_hm(date)),\n         year_month = str_extract(timestamp, \"(\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2})\"), \n         year_month = ym(year_month), \n         president = 'Trump') |&gt;\n  rename(tweet = text) |&gt; \n  select(timestamp, tweet, year_month, president, year) \n  \n#wrangling Obama's tweets \nobama_tweets_ym &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/SDSProjects/maryw-1.github.io/obama.csv\") |&gt;\n    mutate(year = str_extract(Timestamp, \"(\\\\d{4})\"),\n           year = as.numeric(year),\n           president = \"Obama\") |&gt; \n  filter(year &gt;= 2006 , year &lt;= 2017) |&gt;\n  mutate(year_month = str_extract(Timestamp,\"(\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2})\"),\n         year_month = ym(year_month)) |&gt; \n  rename(tweet = Embedded_text,\n         timestamp = Timestamp) |&gt;\n  select(timestamp, tweet, year_month, president, year) \n\n#combining the two datasets together; \nobama_and_trump &lt;- rbind(obama_tweets_ym, trump_tweets_ym)\n\nBefore we do any sentiment analysis, let us analyse how many tweets Obama and Trump tweeted during their presidency.\n\nobama_and_trump |&gt;\n  group_by(president) |&gt;\n  count() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = president, y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs( \n       x = \"President\", \n       y = \"Number of Tweets\",\n       title = \"Number of Tweets by President\",\n       subtitle = \"During their respective presidential terms\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results really surprised me. Even though President Obama served two terms, he only made 10519 total tweets, while Trump made a whopping 30605 tweets during his one term. It seems like Trump has a big mouth, and likes to tweet, considering he tweeted three times as much during his presidency compared to Obama. After seeing how much Obama and Trump tweeted, let us analyse how frequently they would tweet during their presidency.\n\nobama_and_trump |&gt;\n  group_by(year_month, president) |&gt;\n  count() |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year_month, y = n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~president) +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Tweets During Respective Presidency\" ,\n         x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Tweets\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though Obama and Trump served in different terms, we are still able to analyse how often each president would tweet. In just the year 2020, Trump tweeted around 12200 times. Obama did not tweet as much as Trump; however, this might be because social media was not as widely used during 2008-2016. His maximum number of tweets was in the year 2012, with a total of 2652 tweets. As the years went on, social media became more prevalent to the daily lives of many, which might explain the why Trump felt the need to tweet more frequently.\nAfter our initial analysis of Obama’s and Trump’s tweets, we can do more data wrangling to make the data set more usable. First, let us convert all the tweets into lower case, and removing the special characters of “@”, “#”, “:”, quotation marks, etc. In addition to removing these special characters, I decided to remove any links that are present. Links offer little to no information, and is not necessary for our analysis of interest. In order to do more meaningful analysis in regards to both Obama’s and Trump’s tweets, let us use the unnest_tokens to create a new column of individual words based on their respective tweets. After creating this new column, we must remove all the stop_words or words that provide little to no importance in sentiment analysis.\n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  mutate(tweet_lower = str_to_lower(tweet), \n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"\\\\@\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"https.+\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"\\\\#\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"\\\\:\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, '\"')) |&gt; \n  filter(tweet_lower != \"\") |&gt;\n  unnest_tokens(word, tweet_lower) \n\n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n\nword_list &lt;- as_tibble(qdapDictionaries::DICTIONARY)\n\n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  semi_join(word_list) \n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  filter(word != \"president\", word != \"trump\")\n\nAfter removing these special characters and links, I realized that in some of their tweets, there were either typos, or they were responding to other Twitter users. Thus, I needed to use the function semi_join my obama_and_trump data set with DICTIONARY in the qdapDictionaries library to remove words that are not are not in the English language. In addition to doing so, I’ve decided to remove the words of “Trump” and “president” because I felt it was unnecessary to include them in my analysis."
