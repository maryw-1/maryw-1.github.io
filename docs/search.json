    "text": "I wanted to explore how the minimum wage across the United States change with time. Here, I am exploring the years of 1970, 2000 and 2020. I chose the years of 1970, 2000, and 2020 because I wanted to learn more about how the minimum wage changed as the cost of living gradually increased. The amount individuals get paid hourly affects their quality of life. To ensure that individuals experience a minimum quality of life, the federal government sets a minimum threshold of how much workers should get paid hourly. We begin by creating three datasets, minimum_wage_1970, minimum_wage_200 and minimum_wage_2020, each dataset corresponding to the year that we are interested in exploring.\nAs I analyzed the dataset more thoroughly, I was curious about how the state minimum wage differed from the federal minimum wage. We must first calculate the difference between the federal minimum wage and the state minimum wage. By doing so, we can which states are not paying their workers enough based on the federal minimum wage.\nNow, we have to join the minimum_wage dataset to the us_states dataset in order to analyze the minimum wage for each state. In addition, since we are interested in the difference between the federal and state minimum wage, we must create a new table, fed_minimumWage_, which we must also join into the us_states dataset.\n\n\n\nmin_wage_1970 &lt;- minimum_wage_1970 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) \n\n#federal minimum wage in 1970s\nfed_minimum_wage_1970 &lt;- minimum_wage_1970 |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 1970) |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(wage_difference_1970 = State.Minimum.Wage - Federal.Minimum.Wage)\n\n#federal minimum wage in 2000s\nmin_wage_2000 &lt;- minimum_wage_2000 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) \n\nfed_minimum_wage_2000 &lt;- minimum_wage_2000 |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 2000) |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(wage_difference_2000 = State.Minimum.Wage - Federal.Minimum.Wage)\n\n#federal minimum wage in 2020s\nmin_wage_2020 &lt;- minimum_wage_2020 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\"))\n\nfed_minimum_wage_2020 &lt;- minimum_wage_2020 |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 2020) |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(wage_difference_2020 = State.Minimum.Wage - Federal.Minimum.Wage)\n\nThe tables now include the minimum wage across the United States, and the difference between the federal. and state minimum wage for the years 1970, 2000, and 2020\nNow that we have joined our two datasets together, let us now graph both the minimum wage of 1970 and the difference between federal and state minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1, we can see the majority of the South, and a couple of the states in the Midwest region has a minimum wage of zero dollars.

Notice there has been significant changes since 1970; however, the Southern states of: Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee still has a minimum wage of zero dollars. What was really surprising to me was that Arizona now has a state minimum wage of 0 dollars as well. Besides the states that was just mentioned, every state has increased their minimum wage in regards to what they believe was the minimum threshold to have a quality of life.\nFigure 4 depicts the difference between the federal and state minimum wage. A darker red shade represents a bigger negative difference between federal and state minimum wage. This indicates workers in that particular state are being underpaid according to what the federal government believes workers should be paid to have a minimum quality of life."

What is super surprising to me is that there are still certain states in the South that are not paying their workers a livable wage. The states of California, Washington, and the upper East Coast states are continually increasing their minimum wage to match what they believe will allow their residents to have a minimum quality of life. Notice how the states of Florida and Georgia have slightly increased their minimum wage, but certainly not enough where their residents and workers are able to have a quality of life.\nFigure 6 depicts the difference between the federal minimum wage and the federal minimum wage. Again, the majority of states in the Southern region are underpaying their workers. Even though there is a federal minimum, those particular states are not matching it. This affects the quality of life of the residents who reside in those states. There seems to be a half and half split of whether or not states are paying their workers a livable wage. The purple shades indicates particular states where they are paying their workers above the federal minimum wage. While the states shaded in red indicate that those states are under paying their workers."

    "text": "We are interested in how former president Obama and Trump tweet on their personal account. Along with their access to the @POTUS account on Twitter, they also had access to their own personal account. Since @POTUS is the official account for the President of the United States, I was less curious in exploring what they tweeted on this particular account during their presidency; instead, I was interested in what both Obama and Trump would tweet on their personal Twitter accounts. Although both Obama’s and Trump’s Twitter accounts were monitored, they had more freedom on what they posted on their personal accounts rather than the @POTUS account. In this project, I will explore the differences in how Obama and Trump would tweet during their presidency. We begin by data wrangling both Obama’s and Trump’s tweets in order to make meaningful analyses. During this process, I have decided to only include the years of their respective presidency terms. I felt it was more important to analyse how they interacted with the media when they were representing our country.\n\n#wrangling Trump's tweets\ntrump_tweets_ym &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/SDSProjects/maryw-1.github.io/Trumps_Legcy.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(timestamp = mdy_hm(date),\n         year = str_extract(timestamp, \"(\\\\d{4})\")) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 2016) |&gt;\n  mutate(timestamp = as.Date(mdy_hm(date)),\n         year_month = str_extract(timestamp, \"(\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2})\"), \n         year_month = ym(year_month), \n         president = 'Trump') |&gt;\n  rename(tweet = text) |&gt; \n  select(timestamp, tweet, year_month, president, year) \n  \n#wrangling Obama's tweets \nobama_tweets_ym &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/SDSProjects/maryw-1.github.io/obama.csv\") |&gt;\n    mutate(year = str_extract(Timestamp, \"(\\\\d{4})\"),\n           year = as.numeric(year),\n           president = \"Obama\") |&gt; \n  filter(year &gt;= 2006 , year &lt;= 2017) |&gt;\n  mutate(year_month = str_extract(Timestamp,\"(\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2})\"),\n         year_month = ym(year_month)) |&gt; \n  rename(tweet = Embedded_text,\n         timestamp = Timestamp) |&gt;\n  select(timestamp, tweet, year_month, president, year) \n\n#combining the two datasets together; \nobama_and_trump &lt;- rbind(obama_tweets_ym, trump_tweets_ym)\n\nBefore we do any sentiment analysis, let us analyse how many tweets Obama and Trump tweeted during their presidency.\n\nobama_and_trump |&gt;\n  group_by(president) |&gt;\n  count() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = president, y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs( \n       x = \"President\", \n       y = \"Number of Tweets\",\n       title = \"Number of Tweets by President\",\n       subtitle = \"During their respective presidential terms\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results really surprised me. Even though President Obama served two terms, he only made 10519 total tweets, while Trump made a whopping 30605 tweets during his one term. It seems like Trump has a big mouth, and likes to tweet, considering he tweeted three times as much during his presidency compared to Obama. After seeing how much Obama and Trump tweeted, let us analyse how frequently they would tweet during their presidency.\n\nobama_and_trump |&gt;\n  group_by(year_month, president) |&gt;\n  count() |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year_month, y = n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~president) +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Tweets During Respective Presidency\" ,\n         x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Tweets\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though Obama and Trump served in different terms, we are still able to analyse how often each president would tweet. In just the year 2020, Trump tweeted around 12200 times. Obama did not tweet as much as Trump; however, this might be because social media was not as widely used during 2008-2016. His maximum number of tweets was in the year 2012, with a total of 2652 tweets. As the years went on, social media became more prevalent to the daily lives of many, which might explain the why Trump felt the need to tweet more frequently.\nAfter our initial analysis of Obama’s and Trump’s tweets, we can do more data wrangling to make the data set more usable. First, let us convert all the tweets into lower case, and removing the special characters of “@”, “#”, “:”, quotation marks, etc. In addition to removing these special characters, I decided to remove any links that are present. Links offer little to no information, and is not necessary for our analysis of interest. In order to do more meaningful analysis in regards to both Obama’s and Trump’s tweets, let us use the unnest_tokens to create a new column of individual words based on their respective tweets. After creating this new column, we must remove all the stop_words or words that provide little to no importance in sentiment analysis.\n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  mutate(tweet_lower = str_to_lower(tweet), \n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"\\\\@\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"https.+\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"\\\\#\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, \"\\\\:\"),\n         tweet_lower = str_remove_all(tweet_lower, '\"')) |&gt; \n  filter(tweet_lower != \"\") |&gt;\n  unnest_tokens(word, tweet_lower) \n\n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n\nword_list &lt;- as_tibble(qdapDictionaries::DICTIONARY)\n\n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  semi_join(word_list) \n\nobama_and_trump &lt;- obama_and_trump |&gt;\n  filter(word != \"president\", word != \"trump\")\n\nAfter removing these special characters and links, I realized that in some of their tweets, there were either typos, or they were responding to other Twitter users. Thus, I needed to use the function semi_join my obama_and_trump data set with DICTIONARY in the qdapDictionaries library to remove words that are not are not in the English language. In addition to doing so, I’ve decided to remove the words of “Trump” and “president” because I felt it was unnecessary to include them in my analysis."

Notice that we are not super interested in any Third Party candidates, but we are interested in knowing the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes.\n\nProportion of Republican and Democratic Votes\nFirst, we are interested in the mean of the total votes across all 8 congressional districts. Approximately 357796 individuals from each congressional district voted, with a standard deviation of 19345. With that information, we are able to calculate the total amount of Republican and Democratic votes, and the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes for the entire state of Wisconsin.\n\n\nWinner of Each District\nNow, we are able to analyze the proportion of Republican voters, in addition, to the party that won in that congressional district. Notice, a bigger difference from 0.50 the better. For the state of Wisconsin, the Republican Party seems to have won in a majority of the congressional districts. However, notice that the Republican Party wins by a slight margin, whereas the Democratic Party won by a much larger margin. In other words, there is a more significant difference between the Democratic and Republican votes. Now that we have the numbers, let us visualize the data."

Note that the map is color coded such that it matches the results we found above. There are 3 congressional districts where the Democratic Party won, and 5 congressional districts where the Republican Party won. From this map, I wanted to create a choropleth map which allows us to visualize the proportion of Republican and Democratic votes in each district.\n\nAnother visualization of our potential gerrymandering\n\n\nScale for fill is already present.\nAdding another scale for fill, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\nWarning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not\ngive correct results for longitude/latitude data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, this is a choropleth map, where meaningful shading relates to the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes by congressional districts. Similar to the map above, the color blue represents the Democratic Party, while the color red represents the Republican Party. Notice, this map illustrates the same information as the map above. However, in this chorpleth map, we can how much each party won, by congressional districts. We can tell the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes by how opaque the colors are on the map. If we hover our mouse over a particular place on the map, it tells us what district it is, and the proportion of votes they received."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIt was quite interesting to explore the congressional districts data of Wisconsin. Knowing the results from the Presidential Election, I learned a lot about how the majority of the winning congressional districts does not translate to which party won in that particular state due to the electoral college. By analyzing potential gerrymandering data, we can learn more about each congressional district, and how the proportion of votes affect which party wins."
